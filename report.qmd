## Introduction

This dataset contains information about Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) that have been duly registered as of September 30, 2023 and are currently on record with the Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL). A Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) is an all-electric vehicle using one or more batteries to store the electrical energy that powers the motor and is charged by plugging the vehicle in to an electric power source. A Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) is a vehicle that uses one or more batteries to power an electric motor; uses another fuel, such as gasoline or diesel, to power an internal combustion engine or other propulsion source; and is charged by plugging the vehicle in to an electric power source. It provides insights into the demographic distribution, Make, Model, and geographical prevalence of BEVs and PHEVs, contributing to a better understanding of the electric vehicle landscape in the United State.

The data we used in this project is from $https://data.wa.gov/api/views/f6w7-q2d2/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD$.

```{r}
#| echo: false

 # Define the URL of the data you want to load
url <- "https://data.wa.gov/api/views/f6w7-q2d2/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"

# Load the data from the URL directly into a data frame
data <- read.csv(url)

library(ggplot2)
suppressMessages(library(tidyr))
suppressMessages(library(dplyr))

#Data Summary
#summary(data)
str(data)


#Transform columns of the data set to become factors
Cat_Variable <- c("County","City","State","Make","Model","Electric.Vehicle.Type","Legislative.District","Clean.Alternative.Fuel.Vehicle..CAFV..Eligibility","Electric.Utility")
data <- data %>% mutate_at(Cat_Variable, as.factor)

```

The data was collected through the vehicle registration records with the Washington State Department of License (DoL). When an individuals purchase a BEV or PHEV and intends to operate on public roads, they are required to register the vehicle with the department of licensing. These registration are kept as primary source of information.

Here's a detailed description of the data.

We used this data set to explore the following:

-   Which demographics (cities and counties) adopted electric vehicles more rapidly?

-   How do the counties and cities vary in terms of electric range? What does it say?

-   What are consumer preferences? Which "Make" is very popular among the customers and which vehicles resonate with residents?

-   How do the vehicle types vary by electric range and vehicle "Make"?

-   Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility with Faceting by Make

-   Do the distributions of electric vehicle model years provide information about the age of the vehicles?

-   The market share of different electric vehicle types, distinguishing between Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).

-   Determine the distribution of MSRP within different vehicle categories.

-   Create a line plot to display the vehicle price over the years.

-   Create RShiny to display the distributions of the vehicles across all states, counties, and cities.

Some of the interesting things we found were that in @fig-state_avg, electric Vehicles in New Hamsphire had the highest average electric charge since vehicle in New Hamsphire travelled the farthest purely on its electric charge whereas electric vehicles in kansas travel the least.

As shown in @fig-state, about 99% of the electric vehicles registered in Washington state were used in Washington State. Although other vehicles were registered in Washington state, they were used in other states. However, since the percentages of these vehicles used in other states were very low, we decided to focus more on the vehicles used in Washington State. To cater for the other states, we created an RShiny app where we could visualize the distributions of vehicles in all states <https://kenafrancisfunmibi.shinyapps.io/KFFShinyApp/>

## Methods

After reading data files, we used `str()` function to display the structure of the data. It helped us to quickly understand the various components of the data structure such as structure of lists, and data frames. The `summary()` function was used to obtain a summary of each variable in our the data set. We also used the `mutate_at` function of `dplyr` package to transform columns of the data set to become factors using the `as.factor` function. We used the `is.na()` function to identify missing values within the "Electric.Range". The following functions from the `dplyr` package were also used: `arrange(desc())` and `top_n()` functions were used to arrange the data frame in descending order based on the total number of vehicles and select the top 10 counties and cities within Washington State. We filtered the data by counties and cities, by using the `group_by` function of the `dplyr` package and used `semi_join` to return all rows from the our original "data" where there was a match in county with the new data "top_10_subset". This filtered our original data to obtain the top 10 counties with the highest number of vehicles.

For data visualization, we basically used the `ggplot` function of the `ggplot2` package. We constructed bar plots for average electric range of the top 10 counties with the highest number of vehicles, top 10 "Make" of the vehicle types, Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility with Faceting by "Make", and market share of different electric vehicle types. We constructed box plots for electric range by the top 10 electric vehicle types. Line plots were also constructed to visualize the trends in electric vehicle prices over the years. We then add `themes` and `labs` as layers for displaying the titles of the plots and labels for x and y axes. Finally, we applied `theme_minimal()` to make a minimalist theme with no background annotations.

The box plot suggests Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) have higher electric range than Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs). This means that the BEVs can travel farther purely on its electric charge than PHEVs.

Interestingly,Tesla and Nissan have only uses BEVs while the Volvo, Toyota , Jeep, and Chrysler have only PHEVs.

The market share of different electric vehicle types, distinguishing between Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).

```{r, market share}
#| echo: false

# Calculate market share for each electric vehicle type
market_share_data <- subset_data %>%
  group_by(Electric.Vehicle.Type) %>%
  summarise(total_vehicles = n()) %>%
  mutate(market_share = total_vehicles / sum(total_vehicles) * 100)
```

```{r, market share}
#| label: fig-marketshare
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 4 # Change the figure dimensions using fig-width/height
#| out-width: 80% # This changes the size of the figure as rendered in the text.
#| fig-cap: "This figure shows the Bar plot to visualize market share of different electric vehicle types"
#| echo: false


# Bar plot to visualize market share of different electric vehicle types
ggplot(market_share_data, aes(x = " ", y = market_share, fill = Electric.Vehicle.Type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Market Share of Electric Vehicle Types",
       x = "Electric Vehicle Type",
       y = "Market Share (%)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV)" = "skyblue", "Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV)" = "salmon"))

```

BEVs have higher market share than PHEVs. This indicates that BEVs are popular among consumers in the market than PHEVs.

## Exploration topic

Determine the distribution of MSRP within different vehicle categories.

```{r, MSRP}
#| echo: false

## Calculate average price by Make

ev_vehicle_trend <- data_top_makes  %>%
  group_by(Make) %>%
  summarise(avg_price = mean(Base.MSRP),
            avg_range = mean(Electric.Range))
```

```{r, MSRP}
#| label: fig-vehicle-trend
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 4 # Change the figure dimensions using fig-width/height
#| out-width: 80% # This changes the size of the figure as rendered in the text.
#| fig-cap: "This figure shows the scatter plot of Electric Vehicle Price of the Top 10 Make"
#| echo: false


ggplot(ev_vehicle_trend, aes(x = Make)) +
  geom_point(aes(y = avg_price, color = "Average Price"), size = 3) +
  labs(title = "Electric Vehicle Price of the Top 10 Make",
       x = "Make",
       y = "Value") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Average Price" = "red"), guide = "none")
```

## Exploration topic

Create a line plot to display the vehicle price over the years.

```{r, Vehicle Price over the years}
#| echo: false
#| 
# Calculate average price and range by year
ev_trends <- subset_data %>%
  group_by(Model.Year) %>%
  summarise(avg_price = mean(Base.MSRP),
            avg_range = mean(Electric.Range))
```

```{r, Vehicle Price over the years}
#| label: fig-vehicle-price
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 4 # Change the figure dimensions using fig-width/height
#| out-width: 80% # This changes the size of the figure as rendered in the text.
#| fig-cap: "This figure shows the Line graph that displays vehicle price over the years"
#| echo: false

# Line graph  to display vehicle price over the years
ggplot(ev_trends, aes(x = Model.Year)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = avg_price, color = "Average Price"), linewidth = 1.5, linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(title = "Electric vehicle  price Over model years",
       x = "Model Year",
       y = "Value") +
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(legend.position="none")


```
