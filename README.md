Proposed Topic: Comparative analysis of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) registered through Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL)

In this investigation, we explore insights within the "Electric Vehicles Registration" dataset obtained from the Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL). The dataset encompasses various attributes crucial for understanding the electric vehicle landscape. There are nine columns, each offering distinct information: Make denotes the vehicle's manufacturer, Model specifies the vehicle model, and Model Year indicates the year of the vehicle's manufacture. County reveals the county of residence for the vehicle owners, City discloses the city where the registered owner resides, and State provides the geographic region associated with the record. Electric Vehicle type distinguishes between all-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles, while Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility categorizes vehicles based on legislative fuel and range requirements. Electric Range defines the distance a vehicle can travel solely on electric charge. Additionally, two more columns offer valuable insights: Base MSRP represents the lowest Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price for any trim level of the model, and Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility with Faceting by Make further categorizes vehicles based on eligibility criteria.

The objectives of this analysis encompass investigating the adoption rates of electric vehicles in different demographics, understanding the variation in electric range across counties and cities, discerning consumer preferences by identifying popular vehicle makes, and exploring the relationship between vehicle types and electric range. Furthermore, the analysis aims to assess the distribution of electric vehicle model years, determine market share between Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), examine the distribution of MSRP within different vehicle categories, and visualize the trend in vehicle prices over the years using a line plot.
